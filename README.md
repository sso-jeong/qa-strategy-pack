# QA Strategy Pack (anonymized)

This repo contains practical templates for:
- Risk-based test planning
- Test case structure & coverage
- Release Go/No-Go decision (quality gate)

## Contents
- /templates: reusable templates
- /examples: filled-in sample documents

## Quick Start
1. Copy templates from `/templates`
2. Fill them using your service requirements
3. Use `/examples` as references

These templates are derived from real-world QA practices (Excel/Jira-based) and rewritten in an anonymized, reusable format.
